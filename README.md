# Buisness_card
A basic UI-based business card app created using Flutter is a mobile application that allows
users to create and display their business information in a visually appealing and interactive 
digital format. The app's user interface typically consists of various widgets, such as Card, 
ListTile, and Icon, arranged in a customized layout that showcases the user's personal and 
business information.

The app's structure typically includes a stateless widget that holds the user's business 
information, a function that allows the user to share their business card via email or 
other messaging apps, and a widget that displays the user's business information in a 
customized layout.
